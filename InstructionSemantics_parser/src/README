These are the sources for the parser-generator part of ML-Yacc.
The file FILES explains what each file contains.

Note that yacc-grm-sig.sml and yacc-grm.sml are derived from yacc.grm,
but in order to avoid forcing the user to have a copy of mlyacc in
order to build mlyacc, we will distribute the source files and put
them into the CVS repository.
